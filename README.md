# Cruise Control System
A simulation-based control systems project focused on designing and comparing three different controllers: PID, Lead-Lag, and LQR, for regulating the velocity of a Toyota Camry XLE under aerodynamic and rolling resistance forces. This project was done as a part of the ME 5659 (Control Systems Engineering) course at Northeastern University.

### Objectives
The main objectives of this project were as follows:
- Develop a cruise control system for a Toyota Camry XLE to perform velocity tracking and maintain a constant vehicle speed.
- Model both linear and nonlinear plant dynamics incorporating aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance.
- Implement and compare the performance of Lead-Lag, PID, and LQR controllers under various speed conditions.

### Our Approach
- We first build a dynamic model of the Toyota Camry using the car's physical parameters and force equations. Using the dynamical model, we calculated the damping co-efficients for the resistive forces for both, the linear approximation of the plant as well as the actual non-linear plant.
- In the second step, we modeled these systems in Simulink.
- After that, we designed the Lead-Lag, PID, and LQR controllers and inetgrated them with the Simulink models.
- We decided to evaluation metrics for the system.
- Finally, we evaluated the linear and non-linear systems using the different controllers for different desired velocities.

### Evaluation Metrics
Each controller was evaluated using the following criteria:
- <b> Percent Overshoot (% OS):</b> The maximum amount by which the vehicle’s speed exceeds the desired cruise speed during the transient response, expressed as a percentage of the desired speed. It is used to assess how aggressively the controller responds before settling.
- <b> Settling Time (Ts):</b> The time it takes for the vehicle’s velocity to enter and remain within a ±2% tolerance band around the desired speed. It indicates how quickly the system stabilizes after a step input.
- <b> Steady-State Error (Final Speed vs Desired Speed):</b> The absolute difference between the final velocity of the vehicle and the desired cruise speed after all transients have died out. It reflects the accuracy of long-term speed tracking.
  
To ensure consistency, we have used the same gain values for a particular controller for both, the linear and non-linear cases across the entire range of desired velocities. 

### Results
- PID was the most robust overall, providing fast convergence and minimal error across both linear and nonlinear systems.
- Lead-Lag showed fast and good convergence for both systems across a different range of desired velocities. It's overall performance was much better than LQR but not as good as PID. 
- LQR excelled on the linear plant at low speed but struggled in nonlinear cases, especially at high velocities. This is due to the fact that LQR controllers focus on optimization rather than adaptability and hence, they are very senstive to changes in system model.
